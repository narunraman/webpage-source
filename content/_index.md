Hi, I’m Narun Raman! I am a first year Master's student pursuing Computer Science at the [University of British Columbia](https://systopia.cs.ubc.ca/research) advised by Margo Seltzer.

I pronounce my name like Maroon (with an N) Ramen &mdash; quite an unappetizing sight. Some people have interpreted this slightly incorrectly and called me Manun, so maybe I should find a new explanation. Please feel free to email me pictures of oddly colored noodles that you have made or found: <!-- <span style="color:#dc3545">narunram</span> [at] <span style="color:#dc3545">cs</span> [dot] <span style="color:#dc3545">ubc</span> [dot] <span style="color:#dc3545">ca</span>.   -->

I am very available via email, my basic interests are detailed below and I am interested in working in those areas. Please reach out if you would like to collaborate or chat – I would love to get coffee[^1].
