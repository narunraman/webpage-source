<!-- ## a little about me -->
{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpg" alt="avatar">}}

I pronounce my name like Maroon (with an N) Ramen -- quite an unappetizing sight.[^1] Having said that, please feel free to email me pictures of oddly colored noodles that you have made or found: 

**```narunram [at] cs [dot] ubc [dot] ca```**.

I am wrapping up a Master's under Kevin Leyton-Brown and will be continuing with a Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of British Columbia in 2024.
My research interests are listed below and primarily center around understanding the quirks of human behavior in digital spaces. 
I am very available via email so please do reach out if you would like to collaborate or chat, I would love to get coffee.[^2] 

My work experiences are accessible here: [:bookmark_tabs: resume](resume.pdf).

[^1]: Some people have interpreted this slightly incorrectly and called me Manun, so maybe I should find a new explanation.
[^2]: Unfortunately, however, I will need a place where I can substitute oat milk. My stomach was not built for the rough and tumble world of dairy.
