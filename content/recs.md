## Mount Rushmore of Restaurants

### :mountain_snow: Ratna Cafe (Adyar, Chennai):
> My dad's hometown cafe, and for good reason. Probably the best sambar in the world, the vada and idli sambar are worth a detour. Vada is perfectly cripsy on the outside and packs a ton of flavour inside, but be sure to eat it quickly before the sambar makes it too soggy. Weirdly the only thing I could actually keep down when I had amoebic dysentery.

### :mountain_snow: [per se Social Corner](http://persesocialcorner.com/) (Vancouver, BC):
> The best pizza I have ever had in my life. Their dough is apparently fermented for 72 hours and then baked in an open flame brick oven and it just works. I got the Tartufina but I am sure you can't go wrong with any other option -- the dough is the star. 

### :mountain_snow: [Elephant](https://www.elephantinvancouver.com/) (Vancouver, BC):
> Tiny little place with around 15 seats packed together together with their omakase (in reality, a tasting menu) is my favorite eating experience in my adult life. We sat at the counter in front of the chef which was a great but dangerous choice; ended up going in on 2 bottles of wine and an extra course.

### :mountain_snow: [Little Collins](https://www.littlecollins.nl/) (Amsterdam, Netherlands):
> The sister location for brunch/breakfast in De Pijp, they have a rotating menu but the yogurt sucuk bowl was fantastic. Also in a country of great coffee, their mocha was absolutely fantastic. Would love to try Collins at some point whenever I am back in Amsterdam if its anything like the little version.
